## Making Project Management Seamless using Automated Gantt Charts in R Shiny

### Authors: Lucy Njuki and Yuanyuan Zhang

### Abstract:

We are often involved in many projects as researchers in academia. Ensuring that we have the bigger picture of the project tasks can be challenging if not well documented. Recently, our line manager asked us to create a Gantt chart to present all current tasks and how far we are from completing them. R Markdown came to mind at first, and we created beautiful Gantt charts which can be shared as an HTML file. Since the projects are evolving, new tasks are assigned to us. Therefore, to present the updated Gantt chat, we should rerun the R Markdown file.  

A question came to mind. Instead of rerunning the R Markdown file to update the Gantt Chart, could Shiny Apps be used to automate this process? The answer is yes! We created an R Shiny App that can automate and update Gantt Charts. This results in improving the efficiency of project management in academia.

In this presentation, we will point out some of the awesome features of R shiny and demonstrate how our R Shiny App can easily automate Gantt charts and track the progress of tasks.
